## Outline

\begin{itemize}
  \item Introductions.
  \item Practicalities and "ground rules."
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Principles for academic life during the pandemic.
    \item Why MY410?
  \end{itemize}
  \item Exercise: Intellectual puzzles.
\end{itemize}

## Seminar groups

\begin{itemize}
  \item Our seminars are all at capacity – given student numbers, changing enrollments will be extremely hard.
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item If you have to move to another group temporarily (e.g., doctor’s appointment, need to self-isolate), please \textbf{email your seminar teacher and the teacher of the group you wish to attend}.
  \vspace{0.2cm}
  \item Attendance is compulsory. We take registers at each seminar. \textbf{If you have to temporarily move seminar, let your teachers know, and you’ll be marked present}.
\end{itemize}

## Pandemic academic life: 4 principles

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Active learning}. Keep in mind that our pedagogy is founded on \textit{interactive} learning.
  \begin{small}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Come to seminars, having: (1) Watched the lecture videos; (2) participated in the lecture discussions; (3) completed the readings or other preparation for the week.
    \item In class, be ready to: (1) Discuss with your peers and (2) feed back to the plenary. 
  \end{itemize}
  \end{small}
  \item \textbf{Stability with flexibility}. We aim for stability, but acknowledge the need for flexibility.
\end{itemize}

## Pandemic academic life: 4 principles

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Good communication}. We want to make this \textit{fantastic}: Please be your own best advocate and give us feedback and constructive suggestions!
  \begin{small}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Course forum: Questions? Others will have them too. Put them on \textbf{Moodle}.
    \item Seminar slides: They will be updated on my \textbf{Github} page (\url{https://github.com/ccheng11/MY410}).
    \item Office hours: Book on \textbf{Student Hub} (Tuesdays 12pm-2pm; CON 8.01) -- I want to meet you!
  \end{itemize}
  \end{small}
  \item \textbf{Safety}. We all want to keep you safe during your class but need to work collaboratively with you to make that happen!
\end{itemize}

## Intellectual puzzles: A typology (Mason, 2002)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developmental puzzle.
  \item Mechanical puzzle.
  \item Comparative puzzle.
  \item Causal/predictive puzzle.
\end{itemize}

## Exercise: Trying out Mason's categories

\begin{itemize}
  \item Read the abstracts.
  \item State the puzzle addressed by each one and \textbf{explain your choice in your own words}.
  \item Classify each article into one (or more) of Mason's categories.
\end{itemize}
