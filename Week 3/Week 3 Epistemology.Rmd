## Pre-seminar checks

\begin{itemize}
	\item How are things going? 
	\item How are the lecture videos?
	\item How is the seminar structure? In person and online both going well?
	\item Any questions/issues/things to flag up?
\end{itemize}

## WK2 seminar refresher

## WK3 Lecture Takeaway

\begin{itemize}
	\item There is not one ``best'' method -- yes, but why? 
	\item There should always be clear \textbf{congruence} between theory, question, and method.
	\item Evaluating this fit is a fundamental part of being a \textbf{critical reader}.
	\item Ensuring that your work has such fit is essential to producing \textbf{valuable and valid} social science.
\end{itemize}

## Warm-up: Sumner \& Tribe (2004)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let's break into pairs to review different sections of the article.
  \item Let's focus on the following tasks for the time being.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item xxx.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Epistemology in intl development studies

"\textbf{Is development studies an objective, natural science-like search for one ‘truth’ or is it a subjective, constructivist search for many ‘truths’, or is it perhaps both?}" (Sumner \& Tribe, 2004)

\pause

And yet, given that the authors say that "\textit{across every conceivable fault-line the two approaches (i.e., positivism and constructivism) sit diametrically opposed}," how can the answer possibly be \textit{both}?

## Exercise 2: RQ and Design

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let's break into small groups and/or pairs again.
  \item Take an important issue in development studies (e.g., poverty, inequality, corruption, violence/conflict, etc.).
  \item Come up with a research question.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item xxx.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Given your question, what will be the associated design? And what is a possible misaligned design?
\end{itemize}

## Exercise 2: RQ and Design

\begin{itemize}
  \item Additional issues to consider here.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations.
    \item Trade-offs.
    \item Feasibility.
  \end{itemize}
  \item How do you ensure rigor in your project?
\end{itemize}
