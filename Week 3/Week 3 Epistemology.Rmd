## Pre-seminar checks

\begin{itemize}
	\item How are things going? 
	\item How are the lecture videos?
	\item Any questions/issues/things to flag up?
\end{itemize}

## WK2 seminar refresher

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mason's categories provide a useful starting point, but they not mutually exclusive. Certainly it is not the only typology available out there.
  \pause
  \item A research project can address one or more of the following questions -- for instance,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How and why does X happen? Under what conditions will we see X?
    \item Do these conditions ``cause'' X?
    \item How and why do these different conditions lead to X?
    \item Why does X happen in some places but not others? Why does X happen in some years but not others?
  \end{itemize}
  \item Note that we never intend to match these RQs to any specific methods.
\end{itemize}

## WK3 Lecture takeaway

\begin{itemize}
	\item There is not one ``best'' method -- yes, but why? 
	\item There should always be clear \textbf{congruence} between theory, question, and method.
	\item Evaluating this fit is a fundamental part of being a \textbf{critical reader}.
	\item Ensuring that your work has such fit is essential to producing \textbf{valuable and valid} social science.
\end{itemize}

## Warm-up: Sumner \& Tribe (2004)

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let's break into pairs to review different sections of the article.
  \item Focus on the following tasks/questions:
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item What is epistemology? According to the authors, how many epistemological positions are common in international development studies?
	  \item What are the ``problems'' in development? 
	  \item The authors discuss descriptive, exploratory, explanatory research -- what does each of them do?
	  \item What do the authors mean by ``rigor?'' Why is it in scare-quotes?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

## Epistemology in intl development studies

"\textbf{Is development studies an objective, natural science-like search for one ‘truth’ or is it a subjective, constructivist search for many ‘truths’, or is it perhaps both?}" (Sumner \& Tribe, 2004)

\pause
\vspace{0.4cm}
And yet, given that the authors say that "\textit{across every conceivable fault-line the two approaches (i.e., positivism and constructivism) sit diametrically opposed}," how can the answer possibly be \textit{both}?

## Exercise: RQ and Design

\begin{itemize}
  \item Let's break into small groups and/or pairs again.
  \item Take a problem in development (e.g., poverty, inequality, corruption, violence/conflict, etc.).
  \item Come up with a research question.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mason (2002): Developmental, mechanical, causal/predictive, and/or comparative?
    \item Sumner \& Tribe (2004): Descriptive, explanatory, and/or interpretative? Causes of effects and/or effects of causes? Positivist and/or constructivist/Interpretivist?
  \end{itemize}
  \item Given your question, what will be the associated design? And what is a possible misaligned design?
\end{itemize}

## Exercise: RQ and Design

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the ``question'' words you are using (e.g, what? why? how? does?) 
  \item Additional issues associated with various questions and designs. Limitations? Trade-offs? Feasibility?
  \item How do you ensure \textbf{rigor} in your project? \pause Clarity, alignment, and a thoughtful reflection on any potential sources of bias.
\end{itemize}
